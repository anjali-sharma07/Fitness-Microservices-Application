# Fitness Microservices Application

A **full-stack Fitness Tracking application** built using **Spring Boot Microservices**, **React**, and modern cloud-native technologies. This project leverages multiple microservices to provide a scalable, secure, and AI-enhanced fitness platform.

## üèó Project Architecture

The project is structured using **microservices architecture**, each responsible for a specific functionality:

- **Activity Service**: Manages user fitness activities (workouts, running, cycling, etc.).
- **AI Service**: Provides AI-powered recommendations using **Groq AI** and integrates with activity data.
- **User Service**: Handles user management and validation with **Keycloak** authentication.
- **Gateway**: Acts as an API gateway with security filters and routing.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration for all microservices.
- **Eureka Server**: Service discovery for dynamic microservice communication.
- **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **Vite**, providing an interactive user interface.
